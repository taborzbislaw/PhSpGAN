# PhSpGAN
A conditional generative models for phase spaces of Monte Carlo simulators of medical accelerators

Script convertPHSPtoHDF5.py us used to prepare training data (in a hdf file) based on photons extracted from IAEA phase spaces generated by MC simulator (Primo in our case: https://primoproject.net/primo/). The hdf5 was prepared for 567 phase spaces and is quite big (about 0.5TB).

Script generateFromHDF5.py is used to test the process of particles generation from a hdf5 file created by convertPHSPtoHDF5.py

To train a conditional GAN, run:
python3 trainCGAN.py
